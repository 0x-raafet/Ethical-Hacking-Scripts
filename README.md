# Ethical-Hacking-Scripts
More Advanced and Powerful Scripts made for pen-testing developped by me.
I might add dev notes to my scripts if I get bored.

# Please Don't Black Hat Hack.
Do not use these scripts for malicious intent. I will not be responsible for any damages.

Only use these scripts if you have permission from the people whom you are attacking, and only for ethical purposes.

# Warnings
SquidWare and RansomSquid are very dangerous scripts. RansomSquid will encrypt all of your files, and will only decrypt them if you have the correct key(The key is displayed as a precaution if you somehow run it). SquidWare is very dangerous as well, it deletes all of your files as well as ruining your Operating system. ONLY RUN THESE IF YOU ARE ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE OR HAVE PERMISSION FROM ANOTHER USER!

# Updates
I recently reformatted my scripts into folders. The repository is a lot more organised now.

# Other Info
Do not copy these scripts and say they are yours. I am not ok with that. If you plan to modify these scripts, please credit me as I would appreciate that.

A quick note that SquidNet is my most powerful script(It does not reflect on my socket programming skills, as DatCord does). I may make a separate repository for it as it uses client scripts for bot connections, admin connections, as well as the server itself.
