# Ethical-Hacking-Scripts
More Advanced and Powerful Scripts made for pen-testing developped by me.
I might add dev notes to my scripts if I get bored.

# Please Don't Black Hat.
Do not use these scripts for malicious intent. I will not be responsible for any damages.

Only use these scripts if you have permission from the people whom you are attacking, and only for ethical purposes.

# What's in this Repository?
The Scripts in this repository include:
* HTTP-Flood DoS Scripts - Scripts that are aimed at taking down web servers.
* ARP-Poisoning Scripts  - Sending Poisonous Packets to the router for a Man-In-The-Middle-Attack on an IP on your network.
* Packet-Sniffers        - Get your network traffic(Use Linux for better experience).
* XSS-Payload Scripts    - Perform Cross site scripting when you are able to obtain working payloads on a vulnerable Web Server.
* Malware                - Malware that can destroy files on the computer, and can also make it unbootable.
* BotNets                - Botnets that can control and perform unauthorized actions to remote computers.
* Keyloggers             - Log the keystrokes of another person, to possibly extract their password from the keylog.
* Hash Crackers          - Brute force a Hash of a password with these scripts.
* IP Utilities           - Can get information about a specified IP address or host for future attacks.
* Vulnerability Scanners - Scan For online IP Addresses, open ports, and scan for MAC Addreses on a home network.
* Vulnerable Server Scripts - Weak servers that allow you to 'legally' test out Cross site scripting and SQL Injections(if you have nobody's permission).

There is more to be added.

# Warnings
SquidWare and RansomSquid are very dangerous scripts. RansomSquid will encrypt all of your files, and will only decrypt them if you have the correct key. SquidWare is very dangerous as well, it deletes all of your files as well as ruining your Operating system(makes it unbootable). ONLY RUN THESE IF YOU ARE ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE OR HAVE PERMISSION FROM ANOTHER USER! Unauthorized usage of these scripts on other people is also Illegal.

# Updates
I recently reformatted my scripts into folders. The repository is a lot more organised now. I added a few more scripts as well, which include Malware and Vulnerable scripts made for pen-testing.

# Other Info
Do not copy these scripts and say they are yours. I am not ok with that. If you plan to modify these scripts, please credit me as I would appreciate that. 

Another thing is that My Vulnmerable server scripts were intended to be horrible and very weak against attacks(so please don't bully me about the vulnerability of these web servers). 

A quick note that SquidNet is my most powerful script(It does not reflect on my socket programming skills, as DatCord does). I may make a separate repository for it as it uses client scripts for bot connections, admin connections, as well as the server itself.
