# Hacking-Scripts
More Advanced and Powerful Scripts made for pen-testing developped by me.
I might add dev notes to my scripts if I get bored.

Do not use these scripts for malicious intent. I will not be responsible for any damages.

Only use these scripts if you have permission from the people whom you are attacking, and only for ethical purposes.

Do not copy these scripts and say they are yours. I am not ok with that. If you plan to modify these scripts, please credit me as I would appreciate that.

A quick note that SquidNet is my most powerful script. I may make a separate repository for it as it uses client scripts for bot connections, admin connections, as well as the server itself.

Happy Hacking,

DrSquid
